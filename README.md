# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of my data analysis skills, focusing on a synthetic healthcare dataset. The analysis includes exploring patient demographics, analyzing disease prevalence, visualizing treatment outcomes, and creating a correlation matrix for numerical variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is synthetic, generated for illustrative purposes. It includes randomly generated patient information, such as gender, age, disease type, treatment duration, and treatment outcome.

## Files

- `healthcare_data_analysis.py`: Python script containing the data analysis code.
- `healthcare_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset used for analysis.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loaded the synthetic dataset and displayed initial information.

2. **Patient Demographics:** Explored the distribution of gender among patients.

3. **Disease Prevalence:** Analyzed the top 5 most prevalent diseases in the synthetic dataset.

4. **Treatment Outcomes:** Visualized the distribution of treatment duration by treatment outcome.

5. **Correlation Matrix:** Generated a correlation heatmap for numerical variables.
